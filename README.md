For this project, I used Spring Boot to do the backend and the Vite React template to complete the frontend. In the backend, I use these dependencies, which are Lombok, Spring Web, MariaDB Driver, and Spring Data JPA. On the other hand, for the frontend, I use these dependencies: MUI material design, react-router-dom, axios, and material-react-table.
